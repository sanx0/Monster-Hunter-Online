UPDATE: When doing translation please open up your own branch for your changes. When you feel that your edits are ready for review please open a pull request to have your branch merged into master. This lets people see your request, the changes it makes as well as allowing them to comment/feedback on it before merging. If you are unsure of how branching works please read the github wiki or other guides on git branching.

This is a repository for the translation of Dragon's Dogma Online.

To collaborate: PM me on reddit (/u/Form1ca) with your Github username or email address and I will add you to the repo

If you are new to Git or version control please take some time to read through Github's guide on using Git here: https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/

Once confirmed as a collaborator you can now edit the files in the repository. From the main repo page you can select files from the folders listed to edit them. Each change to a file(s) is a save ('commit') to the repository and changes the version of the code. All versions are saved and can be rolled/switched back to so any errors can be undone easily.
